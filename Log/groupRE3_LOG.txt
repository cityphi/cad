***Envelope***
Using a FR of 3.5 and L of 2m gives a D of 0.57143m.
This corresponds to a CD of 0.254.
With a volume of 0.3562m^3 which is 59.3g of helium.
Approximately 101.1g of plastic.
Centre of mass at 402.7mm (in x) from the centre of the thrusters

Max Speed   = 12.5945 m/s
Flight Time = 15.0904minutes
